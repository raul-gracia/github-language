Our technology stack at Unboxed is Ruby on Rails, so it's important that you have a good working knowledge of Rails appropriate to the level of position you're applying for. Typically, this would be that you've been using Rails in a professional environment for around two years for an entry level mid position, or around five years for a senior position. Of course there's an exception to every rule, so we don't mandate these timescales.

If you feel you have the appropriate level of Rails experience, a command line submission for the GitHub test is fine.

This test gives us an opportunity to see your approach to solving problems and some of your code on a clean build project. Although the problem is simple, please do treat it as a real feature request and provide work you would be happy submitting to a client.

Our reputation depends on the quality of work we submit to clients and we'll be using this test to help us gauge your approach to that.

The test is in two parts:

1. Github test
We would like you to build a simple web or command line application, which should allow users to enter an arbitrary GitHub username, and be presented with a best guess of the GitHub user's favourite programming language.

This can be computed by using the GitHub API to fetch all of the user's public GitHub repos, each of which includes the name of the dominant language for the repository.
Documentation for the GitHub API can be found at http://developer.github.com

There is no recommended timeframe for you to complete this exercise in, do what you need to do to showcase the very best of your ability. You are also not obliged to complete the full exercise but we do ask for an indication on the amount of time that you spend completing the exercises. Please use this exercise to showcase your strengths in Ruby/Rails.

2. HTML/CSS test
Please implement the attached design in HTML and CSS.

We'd like you to demonstrate your skills in producing a clean, responsive design.
